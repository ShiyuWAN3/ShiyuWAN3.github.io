This paper addresses the challenge of modeling semi-continuous data where some subjects experience varying degrees of outcomes while others experience none, indicating two distinct data processes. We derive a DNN-based two-part model by adding a bootstrapping procedure along with a filtering algorithm to boost the stability of conventional DNN (sDNN). To improve interpretability, we further derive a feature importance testing procedure to identify important features contributing to the outcome measurements of the two data processes (fsDNN).

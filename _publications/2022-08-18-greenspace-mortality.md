Exposure to natural greenspace benefits health through direct and indirect pathways: increasing physical activity, improving mental health, relieving social isolation, reducing exposure to extreme temperature, noise, and air pollution. This study used large cohort follow-up data from the U.K. Biobank to quantify the magnitude of behavioral factors, psychological factors, biomarkers/physiological measurements, co-morbid diseases, and environmental exposure as potential mediators in the relationship between greenspace and mortality.

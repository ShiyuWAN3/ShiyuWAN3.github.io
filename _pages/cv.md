## Summary

PhD candidate in Biostatistics at UW (qualifying exam passed Aug 2025) with an M.S. in Biostatistics from UNC and dual B.Med/B.Econ from Peking University. I develop estimands and inference for master protocol trials and build deep learning approaches for genomic prediction and survival analysis, including supervised fine-tuning of genomic foundation models.

## Expertise and Skills

* **Research Areas**: Deep learning and statistical methods for genomics and survival analysis; causal inference in master-protocol trials
* **Methodologies**: Genomic foundation models (Enformer, Borzoi, Nucleotide Transformer); survival deep neural networks; causal inference and semiparametric efficiency theory
* **Technical Skills**: Python (PyTorch, PyTorch-Lightning, scikit-learn), R (Bioconductor, survival analysis, causal inference packages, tidyverse), High-Performance Computing (Slurm, GPU clusters)

## Research Experience

**Robust Estimation of Treatment Effect in Master Protocol Trials** (01/2025 - Present)
* Advisor: Professor Ting Ye, UW Seattle. Defined estimands for master protocol trials with re-enrollment and derived influence functions and asymptotic results.

**Benchmarking and Fine-tuning Genomic Language Model in ASE Prediction** (09/2024 - Present)
* Advisor: Professor Pejman Mohammadi, UW Seattle. Applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning to Enformer and Borzoi for allele-specific expression prediction.

**Feature Importance Identifications of Complex Survival Data** (10/2022 - 05/2024)
* Advisor: Professor Baiming Zou, UNC Chapel Hill. Developed SurvDNN, a deep neural network framework for survival analysis with feature importance testing.

**Greenspace and Mortality in U.K.** (03/2021 - 08/2022)
* Advisor: Professor John S. Ji, Tsinghua University. Analyzed greenspace-mortality associations in U.K. Biobank using Cox regression and causal mediation analysis.

**Prevalence of Toothache in Chinese Adults** (07/2020 - 03/2021)
* Advisor: Professor Jue Liu, Peking University. Analyzed risk factors for toothache in elderly Chinese using modified Poisson regressions.

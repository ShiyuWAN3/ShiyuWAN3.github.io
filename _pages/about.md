About Me
======

I am a Ph.D student in Biostatistics at the University of Washington.

I'm interested in developing statistical and machine learning methods for large-scale genomic studies and public health studies.

Previously, I obtained my MS in Biostatistics from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2022.
